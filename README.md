# Hi, I’m Siddhita! 👋

### 🔭 Part data detective, part storyteller and part data engineer-in-the-making

#### What truly excites me? 
The full journey of data right from the moment it’s pulled raw from the source, through the engineering and cleaning that shapes it, all the way to the impactful insights that drive real decisions.

I don’t just analyze data; I craft the pipeline that powers it, blending data engineering with analytics to ensure the story I tell is built on solid foundations.

### 🌱 What I love doing:

- Untangling messy data pipelines to reveal hidden truths  
- Designing workflows that make data reliable and accessible  
- Building visuals that aren’t just eye candy, but insight engines  
- Mastering tools across the stack — Python, SQL, Tableau, and beyond  
- Always curious, always learning, always aiming to connect dots end-to-end

### ⚡  Outside of data

I’m fascinated by the ever-evolving world of fashion 🦹🏼 and enjoy exploring new cultures. Also, I’m a total trivia nerd and get way too excited about pretty much any kind of sports! 🤺🏐
